# reading-flow examples

Examples for the work to add `reading-flow` to the [CSS Display 4 specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display-4/#reading-flow).

To try these out, install Chrome Dev or Canary (version 128 or higher) and launch it using the [command line flag](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/chrome-flags#command-line_flags) `CSSReadingFlow`. For example, on a Mac:

```
/Applications/Google\ Chrome\ Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome\ Canary --enable-features=CSSReadingFlow
```

You can then test the examples in the `examples` folder.

If you just want to view the example in a browser, you can find them published at https://chrome.dev/reading-flow-examples/.
